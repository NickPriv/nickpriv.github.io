    <h1>Story of the Month</h1>
    <h3>Each month, we look at some of the finest independent writing in America. This month, we share the<br> first chapter of Travis Beecham's thrilling novel, "The Hunter," documenting his claimed abduction by aliens in 1975.</h3>
      <h2>The Hunter</h2>
      <h4>Travis Beecham</h4>
<p>“Ah!” I cried as Dan slammed the truck door on my finger. That was the first noise I heard since we felled our last tree for the day. The year was 1955, and something strange was happening in these woods.  Loggers like us had gone into these forests and would never come back out. On this logging trip, I was soon to see for myself what this was all about.  Luckily, I was accompanied by three friends: Dan, Wayne, and Carl.</p>
              <p>As soon as the truck door squashed down on my finger, I leaped back and screamed. Dan hastily pulled open the door and I sprawled backwards into the bushes and landed by a little creek. “I’m sorry man, I just wasn’t lookin',” Dan explained to me.  “I’ll be more careful next time.” He opened the truck door for me and I crawled slowly in. It took me forever. I was so sore from the day’s work that I was aching all over. When I finally settled in, I looked down at my finger and found it oozing with blood, dripping to the floor.</p>
              <p>Wayne and Carl leaped into the back of our truck enthusiastically.  Their straight blonde hair rested casually on their heads. They were both twins, and loved to make jokes, which were funny to themselves.  They were always smiling, no matter how hard the work was.</p>
             <p>In the early evening, we stopped to eat something by a small stream.  Dan named the calls of the birds one after another.  “Crow, bluejay, owl…”  On and on he went, until the birds stopped abruptly.  Everything was still, and nobody made a sound.</p>
           <p>Carl broke the eerie silence. “Let's get to the campsite before it gets dark,” he suggested.  As we all scurried in, Dan started the engine and the truck bolted into the woods.  The sky got darker and soon there was nothing but the moon and the stars glancing down at us.</p>
          <p>We stopped at a fork in the road to set up our tents for the night.  We all got out of the truck and threw our tent gear onto the ground.  “Let’s get started,” Dan suggested happily.  I couldn’t believe he could stand all the hard work and end up happy, especially since something inside me kept telling me that something was wrong.</p>
           <p>“How’d you guys like to hear a joke?” Wayne asked.  He had decided to adopt Dan’s happiness.</p>
           <p>“Keep your jokes to yourself,” Dan snapped.  Wayne looked hurt.  Dan’s happiness had definitely worn off, warning all of us to stay away.  “Get on with the work!”  I attempted to reach for a stake, but a sudden jolt of pain caused me to collapse onto the ground.  My finger bled ferociously and my heart beat 100 times as fast.  I moaned as I lay on the ground.  Then as soon as it had started, it had ended.</p>
<p>Dan wasn’t in the mood for comforting me, but Carl came over to check on me.  “Is it your finger?” he asked.  “Don’t worry, when we all get home you can go and see a doctor about it.  Right now, you can rest in the truck while we finish setting up the tents.”</p>
            <p>Four hours later, I woke up in my tent.  It was the middle of the night, and in the distance I heard a wolf howl.  I looked around the tent.  There was no Dan.  I decided to go and check on Wayne and Carl.  I lazily trudged over the damp soil and opened the zipper flap.  I flicked on my flashlight but nobody was there.  Have they all abandoned me? I wondered.</p>
<p>“Hello?  Is anybody there?” I called hesitantly.  There was no reply. As I headed for the truck, something crept towards me from behind.  I whirled around.  A  dark silhouette was coming at me. I ran into the tent and zipped the flap closed.  I reached for my gun.  The thing, whatever it was, started to zip open the flap.  I scrambled for my bullets.  There were none.  The flap opened all the way, and the thing lifted up its gun.  Its moist, foul breath blew onto my face and traveled up my nostrils.  Then, it started to speak…</p>
