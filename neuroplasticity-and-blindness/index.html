  &emsp;&emsp;It is widely accepted that there are distinct regions of the brain devoted to particular functions - the amygdala deals with emotion, the hippocampus with memory, the cerebellum with movement, and so on. The same also tends to be true in the regions in the brain responsible for processing senses - the occipital lobe is associated with visual processing and parts of the temporal lobes are responsible for auditory processing. We have come to call the parts of the brain responsible for vision and sound the "visual cortex" and "auditory cortex," respectively. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;However, this brings up interesting questions - what happens to the visual cortex if someone is blind? Or what happens to the auditory cortex if someone is deaf? Do these regions of the brain go unused? Do these regions of the brain really only have one purpose? The truth may be slightly different, due to a more recently discovered phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the brain to rewire itself over time, allowing an organism to adapt to its environment. In theory, neuroplasticity could allow a blind or deaf person's brain to rewire itself so that the no longer relevant part of the brain does not go unused. This part of the brain could end up being taken over by neighboring brain regions and begin to perform altogether different tasks from those it once performed. Given that losing a sense is a major disadvantage in making your way around the world, it's logical to think that a loss of a sense could result in greater acuity in other senses. This speculation led me to an interesting question: what is the effect of the loss of a sense on the brain, and how does this impact perception and sensation in the remaining senses?</p></section>
<section><p>&emsp;&emsp;To examine this question, I have chosen to discuss the loss of vision, as this is one of our more dominant senses, and therefore is likely to have a greater impact on our brain and perception when lost. The loss of sight can be a major event in one's life, and as a result the effects of this event have been widely studied. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Upon beginning my research, my hypothesis was immediately confirmed - loss of sight does indeed result in an increased acuity of other senses. According to a study published in the journal <i>Nature</i>, not only are the remaining senses strengthened, but so are abilities such as spatial navigation, understanding of speech, and recollection of verbal information.<label for="sn-one" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Merabet, Lotfi B., and Alvaro Pascual-Leone. "Neural Reorganization Following Sensory Loss: The Opportunity of Change." <i>Nature Reviews Neuroscience Nat Rev Neurosci</i> 11.1 (2009): 44-52. <i>Nature</i>.</span>
 These three abilities may not directly be a part of our sensory systems, yet our strength in these areas is correlated to the acuity of our senses, and therefore when our strength in a certain sensory modality is increased, then our strength in these abilities will be increased as well. These three abilities also tend to not depend on visual input - particularly, speech discrimination and verbal recall are solely auditory skills, only dependent on what one hears. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;For example, a person with capable vision and hearing will speak to a friend not just with speech but also with their <span class="marginnote"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Duchenne-FacialExpressions.jpg"><br>Facial expressions are a significant medium of visual communication.</span> body language and facial expressions. As a result, this person will not need to be particularly strong in speech discrimination because much of the communication is happening visually as well. Therefore, discrimination in body language and facial expressions combined with speech discrimination will result in this person's understanding of what their friend is saying. However, for a blind person, they have no ability to discriminate body language and facial expressions, and therefore their speech discrimination skills need to become more dominant to make sense of what their friend is saying. Their visual discrimination skills diminish to zero while their speech discrimination skills do all the work and therefore become much stronger than the average person's. Increased verbal recall also makes sense - the blind will have to remember what is said to them, lacking the ability to write it down to read later or the ability to read instructions that may remind them of what was said before. What makes less intuitive sense is the improvement in spatial navigation - how, given that this person lacks the ability to see their surroundings, does this person then have an increased ability to understand where they are?</p></section>
<section><p>&emsp;&emsp;This was my original question, and it actually shows a misunderstanding of what spatial navigation is. Spatial navigation in this sense is used to refer to one's ability to understand the layout of their environment based on internal, rather than external, cues. A publication in <i>Oxford University Press</i> describes this very well, noting that sighted individuals make sense of their surroundings by looking around, and from what they see, they can understand the location of external objects in relation to their position.<label for="sn-two" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Fortin, M., et al. "Wayfinding in the Blind: Larger Hippocampal Volume and Supranormal Spatial Navigation." <i>Brain</i> 131.11 (2008): 2995-3005. <i>Oxford University Press</i>.</span>
 Blind individuals, however, need to pay attention to inner sensory signals such as their sense of balance and proprioception (monitoring one's own movement). For example, a sighted man who wants to turn on his phone need only look at the power button and move his hand to press it, at every moment adjusting his arm's motion with what he sees to ensure that it hits the button. A blind man, however, would not be able to utilize visual cues. Instead, he might pick up the phone in his hand, and having memorized the location of the power button (he turns it on every day), he simply moves his hand to the precise location on the phone that the power button is located. This is but one example of the ways in which sighted and blind people interact differently with objects in their environment.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;It has become clear that other senses do indeed become more powerful when one becomes blind, but what does this actually mean for the structure of the brain? What happens to the area of the brain usually allocated for visual processing? According to a study published in <i>The Journal of Neuroscience</i>, neural activity can be observed in the visual cortex of a blind person while processing auditory or tactile stimuli.<label for="sn-three" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Burton, H. "Visual Cortex Activity in Early and Late Blind People." <i>The Journal of Neuroscience</i> 4005-4011 23.10 (2003). <i>PMC</i>.</span> This could mean two things - either other senses are taking over the visual cortex, or some of the processing of these senses already takes place in the visual cortex in a sighted individual - perhaps our visual cortex is not just for seeing, contrary to what is popularly believed. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;In order to better distinguish the roles of the visual cortex in blind and sighted people, the scientists studied people who were blind beginning at birth and people who became blind later in life, discovering that those who were blind beginning at birth or early in life had more neuronal activity in the visual cortex while reading Braille than those who became blind later in life.<label for="sn-four" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Burton, H. "Adaptive Changes in Early and Late Blind: A FMRI Study of Verb Generation to Heard Nouns." <i>Journal of Neurophysiology</i> 88.6 (2002): 3359-371.</span> The increased activity in those blind early in life shows that the lack of previous visual stimuli as well as a longer period of time without visual stimuli results in greater processing power for other senses in the visual cortex. In contrast, those blind later in life did show activity in the visual cortex while reading Braille, but it was less, and this shows that an intact visual system may be tough to break down, and these people had much less time for their visual cortex to rewire itself compared to the early-blinds.</p></section>
<section><p><span class="marginnote"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus.png"><br>The hippocampus, located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain.</span>&emsp;&emsp;Now we know that the loss of sight will allow the visual cortex to replace its capabilities for visual processing with processing of other senses, but this doesn't explain why blind people have better spatial navigation abilities, as discussed earlier. Well, we already know that the hippocampus plays a central role in spatial navigation. Could it be that the hippocampus' abilities have somehow expanded to the visual cortex? Or could it mean that the hippocampus itself has expanded in size? Well, the truth may lie in a study of London taxi drivers. In order to become a London taxi driver, one must memorize thousands of streets, landmarks, and popular routes. This task requires the drivers to have excellent spatial navigation skills, and results in significant anatomical changes in their brains - studies on London cabbies' brains have demonstrated that they have a larger-than-normal hippocampus in order to accommodate all of the information they must learn. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Knowing this, it would be logical to assume that this is the case for blind people - due to their need to accumulate information about their surroundings to help with navigation, their hippocampi would grow larger as well. According to a study published in <i>A Journal of Neurology</i>, the hippocampus of a blind person is significantly larger than that of a sighted person, in both people born blind and people who became blind later in life.<label for="sn-five" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Renier, Laurent A., et al. "Preserved Functional Specialization for Spatial Processing in the Middle Occipital Gyrus of the Early Blind." <i>Neuron</i> 68.1 (2010): 138-48. <i>ScienceDirect</i>. </span> The result of blindness on the hippocampus is quite similar to the result of London cabbies' acquisition of knowledge to become a driver.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;These results demonstrate the powerful capability of the brain to rewire itself when faced with sensory deprivation. The brain can make up for a loss of input in one sense and make up for it by an increased ability to process other senses, allowing a blind person to live a normal life even though their blindness may be seen by others to be a major obstacle to this. Our understanding of the plasticity of the brain allows us to redefine how the brain functions - not as an organ composed of many parts working each for a predefined purpose, but as an organ composed of many parts working together and constantly changing in order to accommodate itself to its capabilities and its environment.
